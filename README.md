# Marco's Data Gathering, Cleaning, and Visualization
  This part is to highlight the use of gathering CSV data from a reliable data source (canada.gov) and cleaning thousands of rows of data to ultimately
  pull only data significant to the report. By utilizing lessons learned in previous modules, data were extracted from the raw CSV file and displayed
  on a data frame cleanly. A simple pie plot chart was also created to sufficiently highlight the gathered data for ease of use.
